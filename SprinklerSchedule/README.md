# Sprinkler Schedules
Sprinkler systems need valves to run the water on a Schedule. This App (Parent and Child) provides a schedule for each valve or group of valves on the Controller. 
The Parent app is a wrapper for one or more child schedules. Generally you would use one child per valve to keep adequate water pressure.<p>
